## Project Overview

This project presents a data-driven approach to segment Vietnamese banks into meaningful peer groups based on their financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. Using machine learning clustering techniques, this analysis identifies homogeneous segments within the banking sector, uncovers strategic patterns, and provides a foundation for tailored strategic recommendations.

The primary methods employed are **K-Means Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering**, with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** used for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

## Business Problem

Vietnam's banking industry is highly diverse, with institutions varying significantly in scale, profitability, operational focus, and risk profiles. This diversity makes direct performance comparison and strategic benchmarking challenging for regulators, investors, and the banks themselves. This project addresses this gap by creating a standardized segmentation based on key financial indicators.

**Objective:** To apply clustering algorithms to segment 27 Vietnamese banks using their Income Statement (KQKD) metrics from Q3 2023, and derive strategic insights from the resulting clusters.

## Dataset

* **Source:** `BCTC_Bank.xlsx` - A dataset containing financial metrics for Vietnamese banks.
* **Scope:** The analysis is scoped to financial data from **Q3 2023** for **27 unique banks**.
* **Features:** We focused on **21 key financial indicators** from the Income Statement (known as "KQKD" metrics). These metrics were chosen because they directly reflect a bank's profitability and operational efficiency.
