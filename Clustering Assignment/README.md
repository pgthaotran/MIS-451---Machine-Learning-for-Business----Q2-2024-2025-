# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project is an assignment for the **MIS-451: Machine Learning for Business** course. It demonstrates the use of unsupervised machine learning to segment customers for a luxury clothing company. By applying clustering techniques, we can identify distinct customer groups based on their attributes, enabling the business to develop more strategic, targeted marketing initiatives.

The primary method employed is **K-Means Clustering**, with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** used for visualization.

## Business Problem
A luxury clothing company has collected valuable customer data (including age, income, and purchasing behavior) but lacks insight into the distinct customer segments within its base. The key business challenge is to identify and understand these customer groups to move from generic marketing to personalized, data-driven campaigns.

**Objective:** To apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their given features and enable the design of more strategic marketing initiatives.

## Dataset

* **Source:** `Clothing_Customers.csv`
* **Features:** The dataset includes customer attributes such as age, income, annual spending, and recency of purchase.
